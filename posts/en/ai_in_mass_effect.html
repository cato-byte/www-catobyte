          <p>
              Hey everyone! Today, I want to share my thoughts on one of my all-time favorite
              games, Mass Effect. If you haven’t played it yet, I highly recommend the
              Legendary Edition, released in 2021 by BioWare. It’s not just an epic space
              RPG—it also serves as a great springboard to talk about key concepts in
              artificial intelligence (AI).
          </p>
          <p>
              I’ll introduce the notions of Weak AI, Strong AI, and Superintelligence, using
              Mass Effect as an exciting backdrop. But first, let me give you a little
              context: Mass Effect is set in a universe where humanity is one of many advanced
              races in the galaxy. The central plot revolves around the looming threat of the
              Reapers, sentient machines that periodically wipe out all advanced civilizations
              every 50,000 years. Let’s dive in.
          </p>
          <h3>Weak AI, Strong AI, and Superintelligence</h3>
          <p>
              To start, let’s explore three key AI concepts—Weak AI, Strong AI, and
              Superintelligence. These terms have their roots in philosophy, not computer
              science. In 1980, philosopher John Searle coined the terms Weak AI and Strong AI
              as part of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">'Chinese
              room" argument'</a> . This argument suggests that no matter how sophisticated a
              program is, it lacks true understanding or consciousness, even if it appears
              intelligent. Meanwhile, the term <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence">superintelligence</a> was
              popularized by Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom to describe any intellect that
              far surpasses human intelligence in virtually every domain.
          </p>
          <p>
              Before we dive into the AI entities in Mass Effect, let's briefly define the
              three main AI concepts:
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Weak AI :</b> This refers to systems designed to perform specific tasks or
              solve particular problems. Think of the AI that powers Instagram filters,
              recognizing human faces and adding cute dog ears, or the virtual assistants in
              your smartphone that help set timers and turn off your lights. These systems are
              highly specialized but lack general intelligence. They’re brilliant in one area,
              but utterly incapable in others. Today, most of our AI falls into this category,
              excelling at specific tasks but without the flexibility of a human mind.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Strong AI :</b> Strong AI is theoretical and would mirror human cognitive
              abilities. Unlike Weak AI, Strong AI would understand, learn, and apply
              knowledge across a wide range of tasks, just like a human.  A strong AI can
              reason and make decisions independently.  While we have no such AI today, it’s a
              major ambition in AI research. In sci-fi, we see Strong AI in characters like
              Sonny from 'I, Robot' or Erika from 'Ex-Machina' that can think, learn, and act
              with autonomy.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Superintelligence:</b> Is a level of AI that surpasses human intelligence in
              all respects—problem-solving, creativity, wisdom, and emotional understanding.
              This theoretical AI is capable of rapid self-improvement and may reach a point
              of technological singularity, where it becomes uncontrollable or
              incomprehensible by humans. This makes me think of the movie 'Her'. The AI
              initially operates at a human level, but as it self-improves, it eventually
              evolves into something far beyond human understanding
          </p>
          <h3>AI in Mass Effect: Entities, Races, and Systems</h3>
          <p>
              In Mass Effect, AI plays a critical role in shaping the narrative and gameplay.
              Let’s categorize a few of the AI characters and systems in the game using the
              definitions we just covered.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>The Citadel VIs - Weak AI</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/ai_in_mass_Effect_citadel.png" alt="Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of the Citadel Station 07th October 2024" class="responsive-image">

            </div>
          <p>
              The Citadel, a massive space station at the heart of galactic politics, hosts a
              range of Virtual Intelligences (VIs). These are classic examples of Weak AI. The
              most notable VI is Avina, who serves as a guide and information resource for
              visitors.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/ai_in_mass_effect_avina.png" alt="Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Avina on the Citadel 07th October 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Avina on the Citadel 07th October 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              Avina can answer questions about Citadel locations, history, and transportation.
              While useful, her responses are limited to pre-programmed topics, and she lacks
              any initiative or memory of past interactions. Avina is similar to a voice
              assistant but with a holographic face.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>EDI (Enhanced Defense Intelligence) – From Weak AI to Strong AI</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/ai_in_mass_effect_old_edi.png" alt="Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Strong AI EDI 07th October 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Strong AI EDI 07th October 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              One of the most interesting AI evolutions in the game is EDI(Enhanced Defense
              Intelligence), she is introduced in Mass Effect 2. When Shepard(The player) gets
              to command the new SR2 Normandy, we realize that Cerberus (the organization that
              build the ship) had installed a Virtual Intelligence to control the systems of
              the ship and aid in its defense. EDI explains that she is programmed to assist
              in tasks that require a reaction time that no human or alien can achieve. She
              also says that there are functions that are not available to her and will only
              be accesible to her if certain conditions are met, such as being attacked by an
              enymy ship. She also has the functionality to protect the information systems
              from hacking and analyze data provided by the commander. Once again, she also
              works as a ship guide and pops up in different areas of the ship, explaining the
              purpose of that section. At this stage, she's still a Weak AI—just controlling
              the ship's systems, answering basic questions, but again, no autonomy.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/ai_in_mass_effect_new_edi.png" alt="Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Strong AI EDI 07th October 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Strong AI EDI 07th October 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              Then in Mass Effect 3, we see a big evolution in terms of complexity for this
              AI. It all starts when EDI installs herself inside a robot (mobile platform).
              She now becomes a possible team member. EDI asks herself questions, has
              initiative, and even starts to explore the possibility of having a relationship
              with the ship's pilot, Joker. She also has a good sense of humor. She learns,
              and she is quite autonomous, so we can say that at this point in the game, she
              is as intelligent as the other crew members (she even has more skills as she can
              control the ship as well). So we can conclude that she is a Strong AI.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>The Geth – Strong AI</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/ai_in_mass_effect_geth.png" alt="Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Geth on Ilos 07th October 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Geth on Ilos 07th October 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              So this is an interesting one: the Geth. The Geth are a race of robots created
              by the Quarians (one of the races in the game) to serve as helpers and laborers.
              At one point, the Quarians started to fear that the Geth were getting too
              advanced and tried to exterminate them. This event caused the Geth to fear for
              their existence and strike back, resulting in the exile of the Quarians from
              their home planet, Rannoch. As we see from the Geth's actions, they have a sense
              of self, a sense of self-preservation, and autonomous decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>
              Another interesting aspect of the Geth is that their bodies  function as some
              sort of terminal. They can collect experience autonomously, of course, but they
              can also connect or directly upload themselves to a hive-mind system called the
              Consensus, a shared network for decision-making. This networked intelligence
              makes them unique and places them firmly in the Strong AI category. They are
              capable of independent thought, self-preservation, and complex decision-
              making—traits that parallel ongoing research into distributed computing and
              swarm intelligence.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/ai_in_mass_effect_geth_6.png" alt="Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Geth mind 07th October 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of Geth mind 07th October 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              It is clear to me that in this categorization, they belong to the Artificial
              General Intelligence category. Their networked intelligence mirrors modern AI
              research into distributed computing and swarm intelligence, where individual
              units share computational power to achieve collective tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
              The Geth’s story embodies  our fear  that once AI gains self-awareness, it could
              turn against us. While the Geth originally served a peaceful purpose, they
              entered in conflict with their creators effectively banishing them from their
              homeplanet.  Luckily, no such machine exist nowadays.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>The Reapers – Superintelligence</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/ai_in_mass_effect_reapers2.png" alt="Mass Effect Legendary Edition. BioWare, Electronic Arts, 2021. Personal screenshot of the Reapers 07th October 2024" class="responsive-image">

            </div>
          <p>
              Finally, we come to the Reapers, the ultimate antagonists in Mass Effect and a
              prime example of Superintelligence. These sentient machines, resembling massive
              squid-like spaceships, have existed for millennia, orchestrating cycles of
              destruction and creation in the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
              The Reapers are incomprehensibly advanced, controlling the very fabric of
              galactic civilization. They built the Citadel and the mass relays, guiding the
              technological development of countless species, only to wipe them out every
              50,000 years. Their motivations are beyond human understanding, and their
              technology is far superior to anything else in the galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
              The Reapers also possess the terrifying ability to indoctrinate
              individuals—slowly eroding their free will and turning them into unwitting
              puppets. This makes the Reapers an embodiment of the potential dangers of
              Superintelligence: an AI so far beyond our understanding that it not only
              outsmarts us but manipulates us in ways we cannot resist or comprehend.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
              If you enjoy thought-provoking sci-fi with plenty of action, humor, and
              adventure, the Mass Effect trilogy is a must-play. I hope this article has given
              you a fresh perspective on AI concepts, while also sparking your interest in the
              fascinating universe of Mass Effect. I hope you enjoyed reading this article as
              much as I enjoyed writing it, thanks for reading.
