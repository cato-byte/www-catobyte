              <em>Opinion Article</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              In recent months, there has been a lot of noise about the elimination of jobs
              due to advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some have even made
              catastrophic predictions, claiming that AI will lead to widespread unemployment,
              with machines replacing most of the workforce.
          </p>
          <p>
              I don’t agree with these doomsday scenarios, and in this article, I’m going to
              explore why, in my opinion, this won’t be the case.
          </p>
          <h3>The Economy and AI</h3>
          <p>
              One of the first things we need to consider when discussing jobs is the economy.
              Despite all the technological advancements, we often forget how “analog” and
              rudimentary many aspects of the global economy remain.
          </p>
          <p>
              Let me give you an example: coffee production. Do you know how coffee is
              harvested? During the harvest season, individual coffee cherries ripen at
              different rates. Skilled workers are needed to identify the perfect cherries by
              their deep red color, while leaving others to ripen further. This process is
              repeated several times over the harvest period.
          </p>
          <p>
              Could AI and robots do this? In theory, yes. Image recognition technology might
              be able to identify ripe coffee cherries, and robots could be designed to
              navigate the terrain and pick the cherries manually. But the practical
              challenges are enormous. Consider the cost: Boston Dynamics' Spot robot costs
              around $75,000. Now, compare that to the profits from a small coffee farm that
              produces five bags of coffee per year—around $247 annually. It would take this
              small farmer over 300 years to pay off one robot. Even in a world where
              technological innovation reduces costs, it’s clear that employing humans is
              often more economically feasible.
          </p>
          <h3>The True Cost of AI in White-Collar Jobs</h3>
          <p>
              The common argument is that white-collar jobs are the ones that are more at risk
              now.” Let’s explore this.
          </p>
          <p>
              White-collar jobs—such as psychologist, lawyers, medical professionals, or
              engineers require more than just following instructions or recognizing patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
              Psychologists helps us understand our feelings. I have asked AIs about my
              feelings and surprisingly they are quite good at providing nuance answers and
              constructive ideas. Though improving everyday more the AI doesn't hold context
              for as long as a therapy program. For example during a long conversation an AI
              can remember your name, your projects, your current situation etcetera. But
              after a few times it might forget important information that you have already
              provided.  A psychologist not only will remember the most relevant information,
              he will react empathically to you and he will also understand the social context
              where you live in. Is not the same to live in a fast urban metropolis than in a
              more isolated area where beliefs expectations and traditions are completely
              different. I know this might sound dumb but the psychologist does not need to be
              plugged to the internet he/she is analog.
          </p>
          <p>
              Engineering is a vast area with different professions, but an interesting one is
              software engineering. Here I see a great aid for the job that is code generation
              and troubleshooting.
          </p>
          <p>
              For the troubleshooting part I must say is a big help as you can give him , and
              I have tried this many times, a specific exceptions that some library may throw
              at you and it usually gives you the corret solution to your problem a huge time
              saver.
          </p>
          <p>
              For the coding part though not perfect you can express an idea in words and the
              AI will produce code or a script that solves that problem. There is  <a
              href="https://github.com/features/copilot">github copilot</a> a tool that
              assists you in programming and has extensions, so you can use it with different
              code editors and developḿent tools. With AI assistance an inexperienced
              developer can write generic code faster or explore ideas where its personal
              knowledge might not be his strong point such as Audio Edition for giving a
              random example.
          </p>
          <p>
              Is the job of developers at risk? I don't think so. First of all the programming
              languages have suffered many transformations throughtout the decades. We have
              passed from manipulating bits and bytes directly to assembly language to high-
              level languages to object oriented languages etcetera to AI. i see this is an
              evolution of language where our interactions with machines is more natural and
              we can express our needs in a more human friendly way, abstracting ourselves
              from the more low level details. Instead of twisting the human mind to fit the
              machine I see it as adapting the machine to the human. Yet besides what people
              might think the job of developer involves not only coding skills you also need
              skills to planify to work in teams you need at some points have good skills for
              communicating appropriately with workers that might not necessarily be tech
              savyy, an AI could help theoretically with the planning of a project but it
              still a human team the one responsible for taking it to good terms in the
              alloted time.
          </p>
          <p>
              Okayl what about lawyers.  An Ai can help draft a generic contract for a
              specific situation yet there still needs to be a human that knows about the law
              to verify that it is correct and that there are not prejudicial clauses and that
              it fits specifically to the case in hand. You wouldn't want to make an error
              that could cost thousands of dollars because the AI put a wrong condition in the
              contract. I still wonder how would an AI go to court to convince a jury or a
              judge.
          </p>
          <p>
              How about a doctor. Can you imagine going to the doctor because you have a
              random pain and when you enter the practice all you see is a keyboard and some
              machines? Can you imagine reading a prompt such as please go to X machine and
              take your own blood pressure, cough in this sensor... What if you don't feel
              like typing much because you feel too sick? I could go on and on but the scene
              feels dystopic to me and I'm guessing that for many of you as well. I would
              definitely want that human attention. Doctors your job is safe and highly
              appreaciated.
          </p>
          <h3>Governments, Bureaucracy, and AI</h3>
          <p>
              Uff now let's look at a more controversial topic government. Wherever we live it
              is a fact that we have to interact with government bureacucracy one way or
              another. We might like it, we might despise it but it is there. Governments
              provide social services, collect taxes and try to promote social stability as
              well as to preserve themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
              In this spirit of things governments might create or maintain positions that are
              not essential, but in this way preserving jobs and public organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
              Since I am here in France I want to bring you an example, here in France  banks
              still send credit cards and PIN codes separately by mail, even though other
              countries allow customers to set their codes instantly. On the surface, this
              seems inefficient. However, it serves to support public services like the postal
              system, and ensuring a certain level of personal security and privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
              I believe that governments will be very wary of changing the status quo and
              replacing human counselors with chatbots for example, as this will contradict a
              goal of the government that is to reduce unemployment and the gains from
              replacing human workers with machines will seem minimal and will definitely
              anger voters.
          </p>
          <h3>Human Interaction as a Luxury</h3>
          <p>
              In our modern society I guess we underestimate the value of human interaction in
              our everyday life. As the saying goes "You don't know what you have until you
              lose it" we didn't know how much we needed each other until we started to
              interact with chatbots everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
              Let's talk about customer service, more often than not we find ourselves
              interacting with chatbvots for customer support. Some companies use them not
              only to reduce costs but as a way to exhaust customers that complain about bad
              service at minimal cost without solving their problems. Some others use them to
              guide users but when things get serious the chatbot has no authorization to
              solve a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
              And here's another point I want to highlight and is responsability. A chatbot is
              not a person it cannot be held accountable for bad actions, you cannot sue a
              chatbot or put them in jail for disclosing company information. So if we're
              being sarcastic we might need humans just to have someone to blame when mistakes
              happen.
          </p>
          <p>
              In amore serious tone it is true that jobs in this field have been reduced
              thanks to AI. Some profiles survive and what I like to believe is that when a
              client finally reach a human the reuirement is quite clear and the problem is
              not as obvious as you need to push the on button on your screen.
          </p>
          <p>
              Human interaction is so valuable that in premium services in banks or trading
              houses the advice is personalized and with a human compared to the low cost
              options that can be 100% digital. We do appreaciate to be treated by others
              ideally if they treat us with respect. If you have the resources and want to
              make a big loan for building a factory in another country you definitely want
              and need to have oine or many human representatives from the bank side to
              interact with you, answer your questions. It makes me dizzy just to think that I
              would endebt myself millions of dollars at a time through a machine. I don't
              think this would be even legal in many jurisdictions.
          </p>
          <h3>What makes us human anyway</h3>
          <p>
              I have been using these systems for several months now, and after the initial
              hype let me tell you that I have found some important limitations. For example
              after creating several images with Dall-e I started to see a pattern in the
              style of the iamges it produc3s and I started to find them a little bit boring.
              I have started to see a lack of diversity in the images it uses. I talked about
              this in another article <a href="../../post/en/dalle3_user_test.html">dalle3
              user test</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
              I have also used them to ask questions about social life for example. My
              impression is that AI answers are usually very neutral and constructive. This
              was an intended feature to make a service that is friendly to everyone. Yet here
              there lies the problem as humans sometimes bad words are necessary. My native
              language is Spanish and part of the rich ness of the language is to use "bad
              words" to express different emotions and not necessarily as an insult. They can
              be used to create feelings of camaraderie, friendship, frustration, anger
              etcetera. A game's influencer I like to follow can say things like "Electronic
              Arts me cago en tu puta madre" to express unfairness towards something this
              company has done. This gives him a lot of charisma. Is also very important the
              entonation and the expression he has when he says this to make sure to express
              frustration more than anything and to connect with his audience. And this Ai
              fails again and again, nothing more boring than watching an AI youtube generated
              video which have become more common.
          </p>
          <p>
              And this makes us pose ourselves questions aobut our own humanity. We humans
              have light and darkness, we are good and evil. We can lie, we can curse
              sometimes we can be manipulative and exploitative. And though we might nowt want
              to look at this darker side of the human experience is part of who we are as
              well. And AIs have been prevented to access this part of human psyche.
          </p>
          <p>
              In this sense current policies have created AIs that have blind spots in their
              comprehension of human society, our society and this is a big gain for us. And
              also we must acknowledge that a big chunk of the world economy is sustained by
              these darker side of humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
              Some negotiation practices can border on outright intimidation or even extorsion
              of the other party, corporate spionage and sabotage is a real thing. Bribes to
              politicians and regulatory bodies are a reality of our world.  Some companies
              are profitable by working in unregulated markets or places where the laws are
              not fully applied, creating profits by not having safety standards. A modern AI
              would never recommend any of these practices, so quite ironically jobs that
              depend on not having a strong sense of morality are quite safe.
          </p>
          <p>
              I have brought this darker side of humanity argument because it makes part of
              our intelligence and what we call intelligent bvehavior. And if the goal is to
              produce a General Artificial Intelligence putting a morality wall might prevent
              this goal.
          </p>
          <h3>AI in Specialized Fields</h3>
          <p>
              Not all is bad, there are fields where AI truly shines, there are tasks perfect
              for AI that are impossible or highly impractical for humans. One of those is
              weather forecasting, that involves processing massive amounts of data from
              thousands of sensors worldwide. Humans can't process this amount of data but an
              AI can.
          </p>
          <p>
              Alpha go is another great example of succesful AI usage. Ais capable of
              predicting the structure of proteins for medical research for example. This
              modeling gives m
          </p>
          <p>
              I bring these examples to show that there are areas where not only AI has not
              destroyed jobs but has created new ones propelling science and improving our
              understanding of the world.
          </p>
          <h3>Degradation of Salaries and working conditions</h3>
          <p>
              This, in my opinion, could be a more realistic outcome of the AI revolution. As
              AI helps automate some of the mechanical poarts of our jobs we might see a
              stagnation of salaries as some companies realize that they can go for AI for
              certain tasks and reduce their hiring efforts or focus on more junior roles.
              Also another possible outcome is that AI sets a new standard for what it is
              expected for a job role both in terms of quality and time to market.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
              What I like about AI is that it makes us question ourselves, about our own
              humanity. By interacting with AI for a while I have come to realize that though
              some parts of our job can be done by an AI faster it might not have the required
              quality for handing it out to the woeld. So maybe rather than fear it we can
              think of AI as a tool that can alleaviate ourselves from  the  mechanical burden
              of our jobs,to some extent, and focus on the more detailed specific elements of
              our jobs. We can think of it as a challenge to discover and expand our own
              humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
              At the end of the day, as long as we value human creativity, empathy, and social
              interaction, we will remain irreplaceable. AI will continue to be a powerful
              tool, but it will not replace the complex, nuanced, and deeply human roles that
              define ourselves and shape our society.
