              <em>Disclaimer: Dall-E 3 is exclusively available in the paid version of
              ChatGPT.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              Today, I am excited to share with you some fascinating challenges I've recently
              undertaken using DallE-3, OpenAI's text-based image generator.Here's a fun fact:
              the name 'Dall-E' is a blend of Wall-E (the adorable Pixar character) and
              Salvador Dalí, the legendary artist.
          </p>
          <p>
              This tool is nothing short of remarkable, greatly simplifying the image
              generation process. Using it is a breeze; you simply provide an idea as input,
              and the model crafts an image based on that concept.
          </p>
          <p>
              One of my initial experiments was to request an image depicting a coffee farmer
              with Pikachu (yes, the character from Pokémon).These are two wildly different
              concepts, yet the result was simply spectacular!The coffee plantation and the
              farmer were depicted with striking realism, and Pikachu appeared as if it had
              stepped right out of its fictional world.There were some deviations from the
              original character, notably the long tail with a furball, but I must say, I was
              thoroughly impressed.The image radiates a unique charm, merging the two concepts
              seamlessly. It's so impressive that I am considering printing it out to adorn my
              wall.

          </p>
          <p>
              But all technologies, especially new ones, have shortcomings that are hard to
              overcome. Now, let me share with you a few examples where the image generation
              went a bit sideways.
          </p>
          <h3>Text quoting in images</h3>
          <p>
              I decided to start with something simple, so I gave ChatGPT this command:
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Can you generate an image of a field and a rainbow and inside the rainbow the
              following text "Carlos is a human not a leprechaun"?</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/dalle3_user_test_rainbow.webp" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024 " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              <em>Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              I must say, I was half satisfied with the result. The text was quoted correctly,
              which is a big win. However, it doesn't blend well with the image; it looks
              imposed and artificial, and most importantly, it is below the rainbow but not
              inside.
          </p>
          <p>
              So I tried again this time asking:
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Can you generate an image of a field and a rainbow and inside the rainbow the
              following text "Carlos is a human not a leprechaun"?make sure the text follows
              the rainbow's shape.</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/dalle3_user_test_rainbow2.webp" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024 " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              <em>Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              This attempt was a mixed bag. The text was where I expected it to be – that's a
              win! The letters were clear and readable.But the main issue, a recurring one for
              DALL-E, was the addition or removal of letters, even though I provided the same
              text. 'Carlos' gained an extra 'R', and 'leprechaun' lost one. It seemed as if
              the model had a quirky form of dyslexia.
          </p>
          <h3>Web interface generation</h3>
          <p>
              Next, I wanted DALL-E 3 to assist me in generating an interface template for an
              imaginary blog.
          </p>
          <p>
              My first command was:
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Can you create an interface for a technology blog with text clearly
              displayed?</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/dalle3_user_test_web_interface_1.webp" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024 " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              <em>Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              The initial result was underwhelming. The text wasn't in English or even
              coherent; it was a jumble of letters. The overall image was quite disappointing
              and far from ready for any production process.
          </p>
          <p>
              Determined, I gave ChatGPT a more detailed request, hoping to iron out some
              issues. The command was:
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Can you create an interface for a technology blog ? I would like buttons that
              redirect to home, big data, artificial intelligence, economy, emerging
              technologies, about us and contact. I would also like three articles to be
              displayed in the interface,The articles should contain the following headers
              "Will robots leave us without jobs?", "How to implement AI in the modern
              office?" ,"The new age of software development". Also I would like the logo of
              the blog to be based on a radar.</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/dalle3_user_test_web_interface_2.webp" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024 " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              <em>Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              Now we are getting somewhere. The interface looks much nicer and cohesive.The
              radar as a logo is present. However, I was still disappointed; there are
              sections that are repeated,such as the home button twice. There is a title for
              every article, which is good, but not only are there letters and numbers
              randomly added or removed, sometimes even the letters seem to be drawn
              incorrectly. The text for each article simply doesn't make any sense. It seems
              like a random collection of letters that are visually acceptable but there is
              nothing coherent or related that can be read. It is quite ironic that Chat GPT
              produces such sophisticated and correct texts, and DALL-E 3 seems incapable of
              understanding even the most basic concepts of grammar. But that seems to be the
              reality today.
          </p>
          <p>
              As a last attempt, I added,
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>I want the text of each article to be written in English. The text should be
              related to the header above it.</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/dalle3_user_test_web_interface_3.webp" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024 " class="responsive-image">

            </div>
          <p>
              <em>Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              Firstly, the obvious: there was no improvement in the text generation for the
              articles.I could say there was even a downgrade, as now the characters are not
              clearly readable. This example has some interesting aspects though.One of the
              headers is perfectly readable according to the given input, 'Will robots leave
              us without jobs?'But the others are not. In some cases, it seems that for DALL-E
              3, the order of the letters is irrelevant, or that it makes weird and
              grammatically incorrect choices if the space is not enough.Some sections are
              just missing, and others are repeated many times.
          </p>
          <p>
              For this particular use case, it's a decent templating tool for creating a quick
              prototype.However, human intervention and specialized software are still
              necessary for a viable final product.Particularly, text generation is a
              significant flaw.
          </p>
          <p>
              Then I asked,
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Draw a sorcerer holding a stick on her left hand</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/dalle3_body_parts_one.webp" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024 " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              <em>Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              Then I asked, **"Draw a sorcerer holding a stick in her left hand."** DALL-E 3
              understood my request to some extent; the sorcerer was holding a stick, but with
              both hands. It lacked the intelligence to infer that 'holding it with her left
              hand' meant using only that hand. However, I could argue that my instructions
              weren't specific enough.
          </p>
          <p>
              So, I tried a new request:
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Draw a sorcerer holding a stick only with her left hand</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/dalle3_body_parts_two.webp" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024 " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              <em>Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              The image showed the sorcerer holding it in the right hand. It seems DALL-E
              doesn't fully understand the positioning of body parts, similar to the mistake
              some humans make when looking in a mirror.
          </p>
          <p>
              I discovered that DALL-E 3 is a fun tool for creating publicity posters, which
              makes sense, given how pervasive advertising is in our society. So, I thought
              about how a poster for a French perfume in Colombia would look according to
              ChatGPT and asked:
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Can you create a publicity poster for french perfumes for the Colombian
              market?</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/dalle3_publicity_one.webp" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024 " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              <em>Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 20th February 2024</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              I really loved the result; it looked so typical, I would dare to say even
              stereotypical, of Colombia, with the flowers, the colonial architecture, and the
              mountains. It reminded me of some rural towns in the country. And the flask of
              perfume looks so chic and elegant, reminiscent of French sophistication. A
              subtle blend. Yet, the only problem is that the text was wrong. Not as wrong as
              in other cases; for some reason, in my head, it even sounded a bit Portuguese or
              some other Romance language, with the accents over the 'A' in 'Fráncesesa' that
              should be 'Francesa,' anyway, or 'Excéconalles' that should be 'excepcionales.'
              The only issue was the text – not completely wrong, but slightly off, almost
              sounding like Portuguese. The text placement was correct; it just wasn't in
              Spanish. But it was almost understandable. The correct texts should be:
          </p>

          <p>
              Although quite cute, this image has some problems. The most obvious issue is its
              failure to adhere to the UML standard. There is a specific convention for
              representing a class or an interface, such as using arrows to denote
              relationships between classes, like inheritance or dependency. Although the
              image is visually appealing, it does not conform to these standards.
              Furthermore, disregarding the repeated labels and misspelled words, it's
              impossible to envision a real piece of software based on this image.

              Once again, we encounter the same issue: a visually stunning image marred by
              incoherent text that fails to adhere to specific standards and does not offer a
              clear enough depiction of a database schema.
          </p>
          <p>
              When we refine the request, we achieve a slightly improved outcome

              While this result comes closer to meeting expectations, it still has several
              issues. For starters, there are grammatical mistakes, like 'Empiloyee' instead
              of 'Employee.' The entity table, specifically the restaurant table, is
              redundantly repeated. Moreover, the relationships between entities, typically
              represented inside a diamond, are missing. Relationships in such diagrams are
              akin to verbs connecting entities, for instance, 'employee serves tables.'
              Unfortunately, this crucial aspect is completely absent in the image, rendering
              it nonsensical."

              Finally, I wanted to test DALL-E 3 with two concepts using the same word. Would
              it choose traffic jam or strawberry jam? The results were super cute,
              surprising, and fun. I asked,
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Please draw a traffic jam strawberry</b>
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">

              I wanted to end on this note because it was the most enjoyable part of the test.
              I believe one of DALL-E's greatest strengths is creatively mixing concepts.
              It's fantastic for prototyping new ideas and expanding creativity, all within
              seconds.One of its most significant weaknesses is the generation of images
              containing coherent text. This issue greatly diminishes its utility for creating
              web interfaces or advertising images where the message is crucial. At the very
              least, it necessitates some post-processing; it's not a solution ready for
              immediate use.Another notable weakness is the accurate generation of diagrams
              that adhere to specific standards. DALL-E is not programmed to follow these
              strict guidelines, nor does it fully comprehend the systems these standards
              represent.My final thought: This tool, despite its imperfections, significantly
              accelerates the process of image generation. It democratizes, streamlines, and
              reduces the costs of creating images, particularly benefiting small businesses
              and individual users who lack access to a marketing team or design
              professionals.
