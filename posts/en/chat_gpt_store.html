          <p>
              On January 10, OpenAI announced the creation of the ChatGPT Store. In this
              article, I will attempt to explain what this new development entails.To provide
              context, I'll review some previous announcements that are key to understanding
              the Store.
          </p>
          <p>
              The first announcement, made on July 20th, 2023, introduced 'custom
              instructions.' According to OpenAI's article:
          </p>
          <p>
              "ChatGPT will consider your custom instructions for every conversation going
              forward. The model will take into account these instructions each time it
              responds, eliminating the need to repeat your preferences or information in
              every conversation."
          </p>
          <p>
              Here’s an illustrative example from OpenAI’s website:
          </p>
          <p>
              “A teacher crafting a lesson plan for 3rd grade science no longer needs to
              specify the grade level each time.”
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/gpt_store_img1.png" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024 </h6>
            </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/gpt_store_img2.png" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              Essentially, custom instructions allowed users to streamline their interactions
              with ChatGPT.
          </p>
          <p>
              Then, on November 6th, 2023, OpenAI introduced 'GPTs' — custom versions of
              ChatGPT tailored for specific purposes. Users can input data for ChatGPT to
              analyze, focusing its capabilities on a particular task.
          </p>
          <p>
              For instance, I wanted to create a custom version of ChatGPT to assist with
              writing technical articles on new technologies in
          </p>
          <p>
              artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The interaction with the system
              felt intuitive. Through a simple series of questions,
          </p>
          <p>
              I configured my 'tech scribe’ GPT.  Below is the conversation I had with the GPT
              Builder to create this specialized version.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">

            </div>

                <img src="../../images/gpt_store_img4.png" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024 </h6>
            </div>

                <img src="../../images/gpt_store_img5.png" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              After this process, you can interact with your newly created GPT in the preview
              section.
          </p>
          <p>
              In the GPT Builder's 'configure' tab, there's a form summarizing the input
              information for the GPT's creation.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/gpt_store_img6.png" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              On the right side of the screen, there’s a preview console for interacting with
              your new GPT. As a test, I asked it to write an article explaining the concept
              of kernels in deep learning and to create a header image for this article.
          </p>
          <p>
              The results were very satisfying. The text was technical yet comprehensible, as
              requested, and the generated image evoked concepts such as matrices and neural
              networks.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/gpt_store_img7.png" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              Once satisfied with the outcome, you can save the GPT either for private use or
              share it publicly in the ChatGPT Store.
          </p>
          <p>
              If saved privately, it appears in your ChatGPT interface for personal use. If
              shared publicly, it becomes available in the ChatGPT Store for others to use.
          </p>
          <p>
              And this is how we arrive at the Store. Once the GPT is approved, we can engage
              with the community by sharing our creations and ideas in the form of GPTs.The
              GPT Store showcases these GPTs, categorizing them into sections and featuring
              the trending ones. It
          </p>
          <p>
              represents an opportunity to collaborate with others, challenge ourselves, and
              explore new ideas that could potentially solve automation problems for many
              people.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/gpt_store_img8.png" alt="Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024" class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Image created by ChatGPT, OpenAI. 1st February 2024 </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              Once inside the store the usage is as simple as searching for and clicking on
              the desired GPT and logging in to ChatGPT.
          </p>
          <p>
              Then it should appear in your interface ready to use.
          </p>
          <p>
              However, I encountered a user interface issue. While logged into ChatGPT, I
              couldn't access the GPT Store directly. The 'explore' option only showed GPTs I
              had previously used or those created by OpenAI.To find a specific GPT, I had to
              open a new private
          </p>
          <p>
              browser window, search for the GPT, copy its link, and then access it from my
              logged-in session. Addressing this issue would significantly enhance the user
              experience.
          </p>
          <p>
              In summary, we have reviewed the concepts of Custom Instructions and GPTs, and
              how they integrate with the GPT Store. The community's role will be crucial for
              the success of this initiative, as well as the effectiveness of the ranking
              system and the advancements of ChatGPT capabilities. Additionally, the
              creativity of individuals in identifying new and interesting problems that can
              be solved through this tool will be a key factor in its success.
