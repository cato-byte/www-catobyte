          <h3>1. What is Machine Learning?</h3>
          <p>
              Machine learning is a computer science field that allows computers to learn and
              adapt based on data, without requiring explicit programming for each specific
              task. As Oxford Languages defines it, machine learning is “the use and
              development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without
              following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to
              analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data.”
          </p>
          <p>
              One type of machine learning is a neural network. But before diving into neural
              networks, let’s take a look at a simpler example of machine learning to build a
              solid foundation: predicting house prices.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>A Real-World Example: Predicting House Prices</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              Suppose you want to predict the price of a house based on some characteristics,
              like the number of bedrooms, the house’s size, location, and the year it was
              built.
          </p>
          <p>
              First, you’d gather a dataset of houses whose prices you already know. This data
              can be represented in a table, where each row is a record of a house with
              columns for different characteristics (known as features or predictors) like
              size, bedrooms, location, and year built. The column containing the price is our
              target or dependent variable—it’s the value we’re trying to predict.
          </p>
<table class="styled-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Size (sq mt)</th>
      <th>Bedrooms</th>
      <th>Location (Zip)</th>
      <th>Year   Built</th>
      <th>Price (Simoleons)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1500</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>94121</td>
      <td>2005</td>
      <td>§700,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2500</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>94122</td>
      <td>2010</td>
      <td>§1,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1200</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>94123</td>
      <td>1998</td>
      <td>§500,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>          <p>
              We’ll use this data to train our model.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Linear Regression: A Simple Model for Prediction</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              To make this prediction, we can start with a simple model called linear
              regression. In essence, linear regression looks for a straight-line relationship
              between the features and the target.
          </p>
          <p>
              Imagine that each row of data is a point in a dimensional space. For example, if
              we only used the feature size, we could plot the data points in a 2D space,
              where the x-axis represents size and the y-axis represents price.
          </p>
          <p>
              In this scenario, linear regression would fit a line to the data that best
              explains the relationship between house size and price.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/a_simple_introduction_to_machine_learning_2d_linear_reg_example.png" alt="Fictional house prices versus house size " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Fictional house prices versus house size  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              In this scenario linear regression would fit a line to the data that best
              explains the relationship between house features and price.
          </p>
          <p>
              Now, let’s add complexity. Imagine using two features instead of one—say, size
              and the number of bedrooms. Now, our data points would be distributed in a 3D
              space: the x-axis could represent size, the y-axis could represent bedrooms, and
              the z-axis would be the price of the house. Here, instead of a line, the
              regression would fit a plane to the data.
          </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../images/a_simple_introduction_to_machine_learning_3d_linear_reg_example.png" alt="Fictional house prices versus house size and number of bedrooms " class="responsive-image">
                <h6 class="image-source"> Fictional house prices versus house size and number of bedrooms  </h6>
            </div>
          <p>
              As we add even more features, it’s hard to visualize. For an example with n
              features, each record would become a point in an (n+1)-dimensional space. In
              this case, our regression model fits an hyperplane (the term used when we move
              beyond three dimensions) that best represents the data points.
          </p>
          <p>
              Once this hyperplane is built, we can use it to predict unknown values. When we
              create this hyperplane, we are training the model. To evaluate our model, we
              could keep part of the data for testing, input new feature values, and see how
              close the predicted price is to the actual price.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Finding the Best-Fit Line, Plane, or Hyperplane: The Formula</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              In linear regression, the formula for the model is:
          </p>
          <p>
              Price = β₀ + β₁ * Feature_1 + β₂ * Feature_2 + ... + βₙ * Feature_n
          </p>
          <p>
              Each feature has a coefficient , which reflects how much impact it has on the
              target. β₀ is the intercept, or base price, when all features are zero.
          </p>
          <p>
              In our house price example, this could look like:
          </p>
          <p>
              Price = β₀ + β₁(Size) + β₂(Bedrooms) + β₃*(Location) + β₄*(Year built)
          </p>
          <p>
              Our goal is to find values for these coefficients that best fit the data. There
              are different ways to calculate these values; we’ll look briefly at two of them:
              Least Squares and Gradient Descent.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Method 1: Least Squares</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              The Least Squares method gives us an exact solution by solving mathematical
              equations based on the data. In cases with a single feature, it’s quite
              efficient, as you only need to go through each data point once. But when you
              have multiple features, it requires more complex calculations (matrix
              operations), which may become impractical for large datasets.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Method 2: Gradient Descent</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              Gradient Descent is an iterative method and is often preferred when dealing with
              multiple features or large datasets. Here’s a simplified version of the steps:
          </p>
          <p>
              1. Start with a Guess: Begin with a random line that doesn’t fit the data well.
              This line has a slope and intercept (position).
          </p>
          <p>
              2. Check How Far Off You Are: For each house in the dataset, measure how far the
              predicted price is from the actual price.
          </p>
          <p>
              3. Adjust the Line: Adjust the line slightly based on how far off you were. If
              the line’s predictions were too high, adjust it downward; if too low, adjust it
              upward. Similarly, tweak the slope if it’s too steep or too flat.
          </p>
          <p>
              4. Repeat: Continue adjusting the line little by little. Each adjustment makes
              the line fit the data more accurately.
          </p>
          <p>
              5. Stop When It’s Close Enough: When the line fits the data well enough, we stop
              adjusting.
          </p>
          <p>
              Why does this work? Think of it like aiming a dart at a target. Each throw (or
              adjustment) helps you get closer, and over time, you “learn” to hit near the
              bullseye.
          </p>
          <p>
              So there you have it—a real-world example of using machine learning and linear
              regression to predict values based on data. There are many more methods for
              making predictions with machine learning. I recommend visiting the  <a

              understanding of these methods. With this foundation, you now have a basic idea
              of how machine learning works, and you’re ready to begin exploring this
              fascinating field in more depth.
