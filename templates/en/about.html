    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>I grew up in the ‘90s, witnessing firsthand the shift from an analog world to a digital one. This transition has shaped my perspective on technology and sparked many reflective thoughts. While I work in cloud computing and automation, I also see the value of ownership — owning media, owning knowledge, owning our digital presence. I’m the kind of person who still enjoys having a physical copy of a movie, not just for access but for the reassurance that it’s truly mine, free from subscriptions or external controls.</p>
    
    <p>This mindset extends beyond media—it's about having control over our own digital and personal spaces. We live in a world of increasing automation, where data-driven decisions optimize efficiency, often at the cost of individuality and real connection.</p>

    <h2>What I Believe In</h2>
    <p>Despite working in an industry that thrives on data extraction and automation, I deeply value genuine human interactions. Technology should serve people, not the other way around. That’s why I believe in strong communities, where we support each other in real life, not just online. We are social creatures, and nothing replaces face-to-face connection.</p>

    <p>I also value personal freedom, the pursuit of knowledge, and human connection. These principles led me to choose a remote, freelance, and nomadic lifestyle. It’s not just about work flexibility—it’s about having the time and space to explore what truly matters: spending time with my family, learning deeply about topics that interest me, and immersing myself in different cultures and experiences.</p>

    <h2>My Passions</h2>
    <p>Beyond technology, I’m passionate about:</p>
    
        <p><strong>Music:</strong> I’m a tenor, and singing is a profound source of joy for me. It’s a way to express emotion, connect with others, and feed the soul.</p>
        <p><strong>Fitness & Community:</strong> I practice CrossFit regularly and appreciate its structured, communal spirit. It’s more than exercise; it’s a way to stay grounded.</p>
        <p><strong>Nature Conservation:</strong> I find nature endlessly fascinating—the rivers, forests, and the unknown creatures in the ocean depths. But I also recognize that conservation is not always simple. Our economy and livelihoods sometimes clash with environmental preservation, and while I deeply believe in protecting what we can, I also think we need pragmatic solutions that consider both nature and people. There are no easy answers, but thoughtful, responsible choices can make a difference.</p>
    

    <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
    <p>I created this blog because technology is shaping our world, and we should all understand it—not just engineers and corporations, but everyday people. I want to make tech concepts accessible, question trends that affect our digital lives, and explore the balance between automation and human connection.</p>

    <p>At the end of the day, I believe sharing knowledge, fostering real communities, and maintaining personal freedom make us all happier. This blog is my way of contributing to that vision.</p>
