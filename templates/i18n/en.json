        "I grew up in the ‘90s, witnessing firsthand the shift from an analog world to a digital one. This transition has shaped my perspective on technology and sparked many reflective thoughts. While I work in cloud computing and automation, I also see the value of ownership — owning media, owning knowledge, owning our digital presence. I’m the kind of person who still enjoys having a physical copy of a movie, not just for access but for the reassurance that it’s truly mine, free from subscriptions or external controls.",
        "This mindset extends beyond media—it's about having control over our own digital and personal spaces. We live in a world of increasing automation, where data-driven decisions optimize efficiency, often at the cost of individuality and real connection."

        "Despite working in an industry that thrives on data extraction and automation, I deeply value genuine human interactions. Technology should serve people, not the other way around. That’s why I believe in strong communities, where we support each other in real life, not just online. We are social creatures, and nothing replaces face-to-face connection.",
        "I also value personal freedom, the pursuit of knowledge, and human connection. These principles led me to choose a remote, freelance, and nomadic lifestyle. It’s not just about work flexibility—it’s about having the time and space to explore what truly matters: spending time with my family, learning deeply about topics that interest me, and immersing myself in different cultures and experiences."

Our economy and livelihoods sometimes clash with environmental preservation, and while I deeply believe in protecting what we can, I also think we need pragmatic solutions that consider both nature and people. There are no easy answers, but thoughtful, responsible choices can make a difference."
